1. As we can see by this plot, total emissions from PM2.5 decreased
drastically since 1999 to 2008. It falled down more than 3 millions of tons.

2. By this graph, we cannot say the same in relation to Baltimore City,
when compared to whole nation. It's decreasing but less than situation asked
before. And, in 2005, it had a second peak, close to 1st year (1999).

3. Of the four types of sources (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) this
graph demonstrates that three of them have decreased along these years:
On-Road, Non-Road and Non-Point. Only "Point" type is keeping same level
(with one peak in 2005). Among these 4 types the highlest level belongs
to "Non-Point" type.

4. Across the United States emissions from coal combustion-related sources
has changed a little in first 3 years of this analysis (1999, 2002, 2005)
and only in last year (2008) we can see a notable decreasing.

5. Emission from motor vehicle sources have been decreased since 1999 in
Baltimore City. But the greatest fall occurred from 1999 to 2002 (more
than 50%). After that the level is falling little by little.

6. Comparing emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with
same source emissions in Los Angeles County, this plot showed us very
different levels of total pollutant (PM2.5) emissions. While L.A. has
measurements above 4.000 tons, Baltimore City doesn't have any year
above 500 tons.
Conclusion: Los Angeles is greater than Baltimore in motor vehicle emissions.
